Please beware, one must install louvain and networkx dev 2.0 module for the code to work
(we tried sys.path.append, but it wasn't working)

Also, I have linked the data and output to my directory, as they were too big for submission

1. To run the program
python analyzer.py

2. Present directory structure
analyzer.py - source code
README.txt - this file
Data/ - metis files and graph files
Output/ - files generated from graphs with the help of gpmetis, mlrmcl and CNM
results.txt - certain results from the program
Report.pdf - assignment report
