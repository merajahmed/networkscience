## Two possible algorithms
## 1) Take frame
## 2) find closest player
## 3) dist >0 and < 1.01
## 4) Compare consecutive time frames upto 4 for ball and see if closest distance changes
## 5) If predicted ball position (or remembered player's position changes), then player lost possession the moment it crossed the distance threshold
## 6) Keep evaluating the frames till distance returns back to 0.something and stays like that
